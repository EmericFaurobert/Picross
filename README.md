## Project

This project is an implementation of the famous Picross (also known as nonogram) game.
It was especially designed for including the following features:
- Play grids within the application graphical user interface
- Measure grids completion time (including an anti-cheat pause button)
- Import grids which are stored as external .pix files
- Create new grids with a corresponding editor (currenlty still under development)

## Environement

This project is developped in C++11 (with an high focus on object oriented programming) and using Qt 5.15 for the GUI.
